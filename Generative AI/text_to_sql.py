# In this section we will be building an end to end Text To SQL LLM Application 

# Here is an Agenda of what we can expect.

#   Agenda:

# : Text To SQL LLM Application
#   : The main purpose of the application will be to take some input text 
#   : Send it to the LLM Model.
#   : The LLM Model will be Gemini Pro.
#   : This Gemini Pro will give us a query.
#   : This Query will try to execute and read from our SQL Database

# This is the entire project that we will be building.

# We will now open a project folder where we will have our code walkthrough as well as everything
#else project related.
